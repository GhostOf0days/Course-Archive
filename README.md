# Course-Archive

Welcome to my course archive! :D

This repo is an archive of all the classes I have taken in university.

Unfortunately, I did not archive many of my classes from freshman year. Therefore, this repo is missing a lot of content from freshman year, including my solutions. If a course in a courses.md file doesn't have a corresponding folder, I unfortunately wasn't able to archive it.

In addition, if a course does not allow sharing of solutions, I will NOT provide my solutions to the homework, etc. as per academic integrity policies.

I will not provide copyrighted material (i.e. Harvard Business Review Course Packs) that I may have used in a course, but will list their names.

If you fork this repo to use for yourself, please do not violate course policy for a course in which you can not provide your solutions. In that case, only provide the blank versions of the homeworks, etc. before you did them.

If you took one of the classes I took freshman year that doesn't have any materials, feel free to add them. :D
