# You can use matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit, or another Python visualization toolkit.
# If you are using streamlit you will need to do this exercise on your laptop rather than using Google Colab.
# The solutions will use streamlit.

# If you want to use streamlit and need to install it into an activated Anaconda/Miniconda environment, you can do:
#     pip install streamlit
# Do not use "conda install".
# Once you have installed streamlit, run this code in the terminal as:
#     streamlit run imla-18-data-visualization-exercises.py


# Load the stroke.csv dataset from last class into a DataFrame.
# Preprocess the DataFrame by:
#   - dropping the "id" cloumn
#   - imputing nulls in the "bmi" column
# You do not need to scale, discretize, or binarize the data.

# YOUR CODE HERE


# Display the first five rows of the preprocessed DataFrame

# YOUR CODE HERE


# Display a histogram of ages

# YOUR CODE HERE


# Display a bar chart of correlations between stroke and the other features
