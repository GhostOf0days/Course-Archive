This semester, I took PHYS-1100 - Physics I, CSCI-1200 - Data Structures, MGMT-4520 - Introduction to Technological Entrepreneurship, and MGMT-4190 - Introduction to Machine Learning Applications. Please note that I am under NDA for Introduction to Technological Entrepreneurship until May 2024 due to the formation of entire startups with 50+ page business plans in that class, so I will not provide any material from that class. Additionally, I will not provide the material for Introduction to Technological Entrepreneurship post-NDA out of respect for startups, the ideation process, and the creation of novel technology.

# Course Descriptions:

1. PHYS-1100 - Physics I:
   The first semester of a two-semester sequence of interactive courses. Topics include linear and angular kinematics and dynamics, work and energy, momentum and collisions, forces and fields, gravitation, oscillatory motion, waves, sound, and interference.

2. CSCI-1200 - Data Structures:
   Programming concepts: functions, parameter passing, pointers, arrays, strings, structs, classes, templates. Mathematical tools: sets, functions, and relations, order notation, complexity of algorithms, proof by induction. Data structures and their representations: data abstraction and internal representation, sequences, trees, binary search trees, associative structures. Algorithms: searching and sorting, generic algorithms, iterative and recursive algorithms. Methods of testing correctness and measuring performance.

3. MGMT-4520 - Introduction to Technological Entrepreneurship:
   An introductory course for initiating a new business venture and developing it into a self-sustaining and profitable enterprise. Provides understanding of the process whereby a person decides to become an entrepreneur, screens opportunities, selects an appropriate product/market target, and obtains the necessary resources. Also, provides the theoretical and practical knowledge for the preparation of formal business plans for the development of new products, processes, and services and for the financing of new enterprises. A student cannot receive credit for both the graduate and undergraduate versions of this course.

4. MGMT-4190 - Introduction to Machine Learning Applications:
   The widespread proliferation of IT-influenced economic activity leaves behind a rich trail of micro-level data, enabling organizations to use analytics and experimentation in both strategy and operations. This course provides a hands-on introduction to the concepts, methods, and processes for machine learning from data, the foundation of artificial intelligence. Students will learn how to manipulate data and apply machine learning models to business context. Students will learn how to obtain data and draw business inferences from data by asking the right questions and using the appropriate tools.
