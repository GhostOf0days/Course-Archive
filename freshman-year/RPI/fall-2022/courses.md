This semester, I took BIOL-1010 - Introduction to Biology, BIOL-1015 - Introduction to Biology Laboratory, MGMT-1100 - Management in the Digital Age, IHSS-1963 - AI in the Information Age, MATH-1020 - Calculus II, and CSCI-1100 - Computer Science I, and RCOS (a pseudo-course for developing open source software). I took RCOS for no credit. In RCOS, I worked on novel features and research for IBM's Kestrel Cybersecurity Programming Language under an IBM Research Mentor. Unfortunately, I was not able to archive any courses for this semester.

# Course Descriptions:

1. BIOL-1010 - Introduction to Biology:
   Introduction to biological systems. Discussion of problems associated with biological organization, scaling, and hierarchy. Major topics covered include evolution, genetics and medicine, and ecology. The course considers the biological components of various environmental, social, and individual problems. Course is taught using both traditional and research-based pedagogical methods.

2. BIOL-1015 - Introduction to Biology Laboratory:
   The goal of this laboratory course is to learn about biology through hands-on, project-based lab activities that engage students in actual biology experiments and procedures - learning biology by actually doing biology.

3. MGMT-1100 - Management in the Digital Age:
   This is a required first course for management majors and minors. In a case-based format, it emphasizes broad, basic principles of managerial functions and processes using an interdisciplinary approach to goal-oriented situations of private and public organizations.

4. IHSS-1963 - AI in the Information Age:
   In this course, we will explore the nature of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how will it shape the world in the decades to come. The course examines the ideas that enable machines to see, use language, and reason, and investigates how these machines will affect the world. The progression of AI-based technologies promises to transform many aspects of society. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the capabilities of modern AI technologies, with an emphasis on being able to critically assess where they can provide societal value, and where they may create new societal challenges.

5. MATH-1020 - Calculus II:
   Techniques and applications of integration, polar coordinates, parametric equations, infinite sequences and series, vector functions and curves in space, functions of several variables, and partial derivatives.

6. CSCI-1100 - Computer Science I:
   An introduction to computer programming algorithm design and analysis. Additional topics include basic computer organization; internal representation of scalar and array data; use of top-down design and subprograms to tackle complex problems; abstract data types. Enrichment material as time allows. Interdisciplinary case studies, numerical and nonnumerical applications. Students who have passed CSCI 1200 cannot register for this course.

7. RCOS - Rensselaer Center for Open Source:
   RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source) is an eclectic group of undergraduate students that embark on individual and team-based open source projects, primarily software, but also open hardware projects. Many new projects are introduced each semester, though many ongoing and "higher-profile" projects are also undertaken. Overall, students are required to work on and contribute to open source projects, in particular through multiple commits (commit early, commit often), maintaining a blog, presenting their work and/or specific technical talks, mentoring other projects, etc. This project-based "course" may be taken multiple semesters, with grades based on clear effort and contributions rather than a project that meets all of its requirements.
